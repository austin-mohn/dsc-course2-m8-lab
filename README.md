Weather and purpose of flight also have an impact of injury and destruction rates. IMC weather conditions (low visibility) are more likely to increate both rates for all plane sizes. Air race shows are the most dangerous for small planes, where larger planes have increased injury rates when ferrying and highest destruction rate comes from personal use and skydiving.
